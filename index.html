    <p>I find it interesting that we believe we are more <strong>logical</strong> than we actually are. If you were able to analyze
      your beliefs you would learn that most of your beliefs and values were a product of your emotions. What we think is
      <strong>our logic is very dependent on our emotions.</strong> You can be presented the same idea, and your mood will
      primarily define what you think of that idea. This article dives deeper into that
      idea <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4050437/">Logic or Emotion?</a>

      I also find the existence of god very interesting so here is a Youtube video on
      that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqWTlUOhowk">"The Strongest arguments for and against the existence of
      God"</a>. Also below is an image of the $uicide boy$, my favorite musical artists.
